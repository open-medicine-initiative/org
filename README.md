# Open Medicine Initiative e.V.

Welcome to one of the public facing sites of the Open Medicine Initiative e.V! The initiative was founded to support patient empowerment and ideas of non-profit, open health care information services. One of our main efforts is the coordination and development of [OPENMEDiAID](http://www.openmediaid.org) - an online platform built on open medical data and patient's medical experiences.

Read the [preamble](articles-of-association/en/#preamble) of our articles of assocation to get an idea of our core motivation and values. 

### Transparency
Transparency is a key aspect for building communities and a core principle of our organization. We have built transparency right into our [articles of association](articles-of-association/en/#toc-10).  We have committed ourselves to publish any relevant document related to our activities: protocols of [meetings](meetings) and resolutions, [financial statements](financials), annual reports.

### Democratic Decision Making
We are also trying to make group decisions of decentralized groups possible with the help of online tools. This is why we have the option to conduct [virtual meetings of members](articles-of-association/en/#toc-7.2).

[Loomio](http://boingboing.net/2014/03/19/loomio-democratic-decision-ma.html) is a great, open source tool for lean management of group decision processes. Groups of people can initiate proposals, discuss them and finally vote on it. Members can easily create sub-groups for more detailed discussions and everybody can participate in any issue of her/his interest. Every member of the organization will be a member of the [open medicine group](https://www.loomio.org/g/EedHvuAr/open-medicine-e-v).
